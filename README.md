I'd like to thank you for attending my session at Boise Code Camp 2017 and I hope you have lots of fun ideas to implement in PowerShell going forward

In this repository I have included the code samples I used, as well as references to further information, blogs, articles and code by 3rd parties that I used for demonstration purposes

Happy Coding
